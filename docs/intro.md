# Tensorflow and Deep Learning

## What is deep learning?
a type of machine learning based on artificial neural networks in which multiple layers of processing are used to extract progressively higher level features from data.


## What is Machine Learning?
ML is turning things (data) into numebrs and finding patterns in those numbers.


## What depp learning is good for?
1. Problems with long lists of rules -> when the traditional appraoch fails, machine learning/deep learning may help.
2. Continually changing environments -> DL can adapt (learn) to new scenarios.
3. Discovering insights within large collections of data -> imagine trying to hand-craft rules for what 1000 different kinds of food look like ?

## What deep learning is not good for?
1. When you need explainability -> patterns learned through DL are uninterpretable by humans
2. When traditional approach is a better option -> if it can be achieved using simple rule-based approach then use it.
3. When errors are unacceptable -> outputs of DL aren't predictable it may contain soem errors.
4. When you dont have enough data -> DL models requires a fairly large amount of data to produce great resutls.
